# Support-Vector-Machine Algorithm for Titanic Data Prediction
This repository is a simple Python implementation of SVM using Sklearn

- [ ] Linear SVM for 2 classes
- [x] Kernel SVM for 2 classes
- [ ] Multi classification

## Python environment
It's recommended to install a virtual environment

For activating the virtual environment,

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

To deactivate, just run ```deactivate```.

Then, you need to install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can install just the requirements if you don't want to create a
virtual environment.

Description
-----------

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. This repository hosts a basic implementation of the SVM algorithm for classification purposes.
